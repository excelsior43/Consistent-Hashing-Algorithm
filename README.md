1. Performance) 
  Things that enhance the performance of any website :
    1) using a good event ased webserver, rather that a thread based.
    2) Proper caching of data 
    3) Denormalization of data.. No need to have complex db operations... 

2. APIs)  
  To improve the quality of service for a heavy weight site like dubizzle, We need to gave good 
RESTful API on the concepts of HATEOAS - hypermedia as the engine of application state


3. Programming)
    a) I have used continuous hashing algorithm. 
    b) <CODE>def rand_7():
        q = 0
        for i in xrange(7):  q+= rand_5()
        return q%7 + 1 </CODE>
