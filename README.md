Consistent Hashing algorithm
============================

 I have used Consistent hashing algorithm<sup>[1]</sup>. The lost keys are 1/n of the total number of keys. This means the successful key fetch will be 6/7 *100 around 85%. <br>Please download this repository and run the following command. I found this blog (http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/consistent-hashing/) very informative for implementing consistent hash, I tailored the available code to solve the assignment. 
```
$ [sudo] python mamcache_client.py
```
